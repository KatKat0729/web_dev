<h1>Why I love Rats</h1>

<div id="content-wrapper">
<div id="left">
    <p>Rats are my favorite animals for many reasons, but one of the main ones is personalities. <br>
        I have had four pet rats in my life, and I haven't regretted my choice in getting them once. All four of them have had the most amazing personalities. 
        One of my rats was really shy, but she was very curious and loved to play. Another rat I had was very playful, and had no problem being picked, she was a little bundle of joy
        until the very end.  My current rats are very special, one of them is very anxious, and a little gremlin. He hoards food, and pushes you if you're in his way, and he bullies his brother all of the time, 
        but we all know he secretly loves him. Finally, my last rat, who is the most cuddly little guy in the world. He will lay in my lap and just let me pet him for hours.
        He is very curious, and he's also probably a little deaf, as well as blind, but he is such a sweetheart.</p>
