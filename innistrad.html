        <h1>World Lore</h1>
        <p>Instranova, Solas, Elhorel, and Ubris. Thoes were thr four gods who, together, contributed to the creation of Innistrad. Ubris, god of the deep sea, created the ocean. Deep, dark, and intense. Elhorel, created the Elheleir, the underworld, where fire burned, hot and bright. Solas, created the Solascalem, a place of pure, burning light. And lastly, Instranova, the creator of life itself. But soon, conflict arose. Elhorel, wanted to give humans the gift of <em>knowing,</em> but Ubris though that humans would destroy the gods beautiful creation with the power of knowledge. Together, Elhorel, Instranova, and Solas banished Ubris, sending him deep into the ocean to perish. But soon after, Elhorel grew bitter, wanting all of the power for himself, and so, Solas and Instranova banished Elhorel to Elheleir, where he too, perished. But that wasn't it, Solas and Innstranova started fighting, and so, Solas was banished to the Solascalem, to perish as well. Innstranova, engulfed with sadness at the loss of her siblings, decided to take her life, to spread her magic throughout humankind. And that's what heppened. Her magic, collided with every being in Innistrad. That's what we call a soul, a part of Instranova. <br> In the death of the gods, powerful beings were created. The Archangels, and the Demons. Liesa, the oldest, angel of shadow, and choice. Bruna, the second oldest, angel of death and knowledge. Gisella, angel of war, and the youngest, Sigarda, angel of nature. Together they ruled over innistrad. </p>
