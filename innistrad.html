        <h2><i>A Tale of Innistrads Design</i></h2>
            <p><i>
                More than all of everything that exists in reality, there is nothing. This vast nothing that cradles<br> 
                life and existence is the Blind Eternities. Within the Blind Eternities, magic flows and pools.<br><br>
                Newly immortal, four young gods discovered a powerful intersection of magical energy. With<br> 
                their budding power, they brought shape and order to the chaos.<br><br>
                Ubris - the first - created the vast and powerful Ocean designed after the Eternities themselves,<br> 
                and it was everything.<br><br>
                Elhorrel - the second - fabricated the towering Mountains and vast continents with their<br> 
                cavernous depths, and they rose above everything.<br><br>
                Solis - the third - shaped the vast Skies and space that locked the world together, and it<br> 
                shrouded everything.<br><br>
                Instranova - the last - begot the flourishing forests and rolling fields of grass, the beasts of the<br> 
                wood and the creatures of the deep, and they bloomed across everything.
                <br>
                <br>
                ✧
                <br>
                <br>
                Though the gods were pleased with their creation, Instranova grew saddened. She besought her<br> 
                brothers and sisters that they might join their power once more to grant the gift of knowing to<br> 
                mortal kind.<br><br>
                Instranova saw the beauty of knowing. She knew that their creation would use it to treasure and<br> 
                feel existence, that it would grow and change with them. She swore they may one day transcend<br> 
                the gods themselves in creation.<br><br>
                Solis saw the value of knowing. She knew their creation would use it to foster understanding,<br> 
                perpetuity, and connection. She swore to see them take form.<br><br>
                Elhorrel saw the potential of knowing. He knew their creation would desire power, prosperity,<br> 
                and will. He swore to see them climb and master the world.<br><br>
                Ubris saw the folly of knowing. He knew their creation would use it to ruin and destroy, and<br> 
                more than anything, he wished to defend their perfect world from cruelty, waste, greed, and war.<br> 
                Ubris swore to protect and preserve his love.
                <br>
                <br>
                ✧
                <br>
                <br>
                The triplet gods, angry and determined, devised a plot. The triplet gods promised a reunion.<br> 
                The triplet gods lied.<br><br>
                They weaved the ancient ley lines together and bound the First. Ubris lost his power, and they<br> 
                wrested his essence from his body and cast it into the Blind Eternities. His body became the<br> 
                waves of the Sea.<br><br>
                When Ubris fell, they granted mortal kind the gift of knowing and celebrated the dawn of a new<br> 
                age.<br><br>
                Elhorel fomented his design and brought himself before the newly realized mortals. He<br> 
                demanded worship and gratitude for the gift. Solis and Instranova, horrified by Elhorrel's<br> 
                command, overpowered and enfeebled him.<br><br> 
                Defeated and rebuked, Elhorrel swore that if he could not dominate mortal kind, he would<br> 
                destroy them. He descended to the heart of his creation and ignited his essence, bathing the<br> 
                world's core in flames. His body became Elhelier— the fiery realm of the Demonlords.<br><br>
                His twisted creations began to raze and destroy their people; harbingers of the twilight of the new<br> 
                age.<br><br>
                The twin gods wept and mourned, but Solis knew that mortal kind could not stand against the<br> 
                Demonlords. On the brink of their extinction, she ascended into the distant skies and unfolded<br> 
                her essence, bathing the world in light. The magic of the martyred god spawned the Soliscaelum<br> 
                — the luminous realm of the Archangels.<br><br>
                The lone god Instranova chartered her sister's angelic creations toward the protection of their<br> 
                people. The Archangel Sisters heralded the Age of Divine Conflict, the timeless struggle of<br> 
                light against dark.<br><br>
                Alone and abandoned, Instranova used her power to read the magic of time. She saw mortal<br> 
                kind splinter and divide. Heartbroken, Instranova brought herself before her creations and<br> 
                shattered her essence, giving each of them a piece of divinity— and with it, a hope and a chance<br> 
                for something different.<br><br>
                Instranova had fallen, and mortal kind honored her great sacrifice. They named themselves the<br> 
                Innastri people and their world Innistrad after their savior.<br><br>
                The Archangels of the Soliscaelum and the Demonlords of Elhelier fight on still— but within<br> 
                their people, the same beautiful affliction is shared.<br><br>
                The growth of struggle. The pain of sorrow. The blessed finality of death.<br><br>

<h1>Geography</h1>
    <p>
        <b>GAVONY</b> - <br>Landmarked by the City of <b>Thraben</b>, Gavony has the largest population in Innistrad. It is patrolled by the <em>Riders of Gavony</em>, a sect of the Avacynian military, and is considered the safest of the four regions. While <b>Hanweir</b> is largely ungoverned, Thraben is managed and protected by the <b><i>Church of Avacyn</i></b>.<br> 

        <br><b>STENSIA</b> - <br>Colloquially known as <en>'vampire land'</en> since the rise of the vampire houses, Stensia has sparse civilizations and unpredictable weather patterns due to the <b><en>Ashmouth</en></b>. The Ashmouth, right at the center, is the <i>largest known doorway to <b>Elhelier</b></i>, strictly guarded by the <i>Gryffriders</i>. Witches are rumored to practice in this region.<br>

        <br><b>KESSIG</b> - <br>Blanketed by the <i>Ulvenwald forest</i>, Kessig sprawls through the middle of Innistrad. <b>Gastaff</b> is at its heart, and to the very south, <b>Avabruck</b> is islanded. The two have tight trade relationships and are largely self sustaining, though the <i>Avacynian Wilderangers</i> keep protective tabs on them. The size of the Ulvenwald forest has shrunk considerably in the last twenty years, and after the loss of Trostad to <b><i>Geralf</i></b>, the mountain mines have been abandoned. <br>

        <br><b>NEPHALIA</b> - <br>With <b>Havengull</b> at its capital, Nephalia is a region of trade and industry sustained by the coast and the <i>University of Drunau</i>. It's home to <i>Jenrick's tower</i>, and further south, <b>Rivstalt</b> is run and operated by <i>House Gallan</i>. While the coast used to be heavily populated by ships and harbors, those have since all but disappeared after Innistrad's oceans became tumultuous. The ocean is now considered too dangerous to travel through and Havengull in particular has suffered from it. 
    </p>

<h1><b><i>Archangels</i></b></h1>
        <ul>
            <li><b><i>Archangel Liesa</i></b> was the first angel of Innistrad. She is associated with contracts, shadow, balance, and fate.
                The least seen of the sisters, she also does not take any Chosen (as far as anyone knows).
                Her history is shrouded in mysters and her methods are unknown. She is rarely armed when seen.</li>

            <br><li><b>Archangel Bruna</b> is associated with knowledge, death, and perservation. Her chosen are 
                scholars and historians, and much of her time is spent in Thraben, where she uses her knowledge 
                of runes to keep the city magically protected.</li>

            <br><li><b>Archangel Gisella</b> is a warrior. Her Chosen are soldiers and combatants, 
                and she ascends more humans to angelic status than any other Archangel. Single-minded
                and deadly, she can usually be found in the Avacynian military or areas of high conflict.</li>

            <br><li><b>Sigarda</b> is the Archangel of travelers. She's wild and unruly, usually handing our her magic 
                freely to those who ask or inspore her. Her unpredictable nature makes her difficult to track down,
                but she still interacts with humans more than other Archangels. Buring the Green War between her 
                and Demonlord Balthor, Lycanthropy was created.</li>

            <br><li><b><i>Archangel Avacyn</i></b> 700 years ago, Avacyn appeared and saved humanity from extinction.
                She then created the Church and aided in the establishing of Thraben. She is closely tied with the Lunarch 
                and seems to be much more powerful than her elder sisters.</li>
        </ul>

<h2><b><i>Demonlords</i></b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b><i>Kathoped</i></b></li>
        <li><b><i>Ormendahl</i></b></li>
        <li><b>Balthor</b></li>
        <li><i><b>????.</i></b> Unknown.</li>
    </ul>

    <p id="sessionRecapsContent"><b>SESSION 1  [Avabruck]  -</b> <br>
        It's the new year in Innistrad: year 700. Meredith was given an escort mission for Adrien Cadault, they met and went south through Gastaff, where Skillet the bounty hunter captured his target and got a new mission.
         Close by, Solanine was visited by the powerful and cryptic Archangel Liesa. Everyone traveled to Avabruck, where Zeph had been hired by a friendly rancher he met earlier. Some shopping, chatting, and licking later, they all met in City Hall.</p>
